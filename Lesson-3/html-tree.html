  <h1>Ethereum</h1>
  <div>
  	<p>Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality. More specifically, it is a distributed ledger for state transitions. It is the bockchain network for Ether, a cryptocurrency.</p>
  	<p>Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.[2] Etherium provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.</p>
