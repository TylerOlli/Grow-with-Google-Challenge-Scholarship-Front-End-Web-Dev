You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?

  I have learned how to properly use the <figure> and <figcaption> tags. I have previously only used <img> and <p> tags for images and their respective captions.

  * What has been easy?

  I already know basic HTML, so everything so far has been more of a review. Regardless it has been very benefical reading through Mozilla's Web Docs.

  * What has been difficult?

  I have a hard time knowing when something is completely done. I am always re-reading my code over and over again to make sure it is not only correct, but written in the most effecient manner possible. 

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  It has shown me that there are multiple ways to do something while writing code.
